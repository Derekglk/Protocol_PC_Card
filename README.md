# Protocol_PC_Card

Younes,

To use github, we only need several commands

1. git clone URL	//This is to copy the projet to local repository. for example, git clone https://github.com/uestclx/Protocol_PC_Card.git

2. git status		//To know the differences between the codes online and the local code

3. git add file     //This is to add a file to the synchronisation list

4. git commit -m "message"		//This is to save the changement, but not synchronized yet with the server

5. git push			//This is to push the local commited files to the server

6. git pull			//This is to download the online files, same function with "svn update"

* And to note that all these commands except the "clone", have to be runned under the git repository.
* The connection is a little bit slow, be patient ;)
* It seems like that everytime before "push", we need to "add" then "commit", and we can "push".
